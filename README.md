Codecademy final project to use a supplied markov chain to generate a random bass rift.

use ./bass_guitar_tabs.txt to generate a markov chain inorder to produce a 'random' sensible bass rift based on existing music samples.

I have manually entered a number of bass tabs as a proof of concept.  but I will try to automate that process from a database of bass guitar music in the future.

There is also a number of other text files as input.  carols is a fun one.

I expect I will have to increase num_key_words in markov.txt to get better results.
